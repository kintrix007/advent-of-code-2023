# Day 07 - Camel Cards

Since the input needed to be interpreted differently between the parts, I
decided not to try to fit them into a single solution, as it would have
required a lot of time. What you can see here is my solution to part 2.

If you want to look at my solution to part 1, check out this commit:
`808613cf79b91d3b11d2aa8fa3d175b4e60eff90`.

```sh
git checkout 808613cf79b91d3b11d2aa8fa3d175b4e60eff90
```

To return here, run the following:

```sh
git checkout master
```

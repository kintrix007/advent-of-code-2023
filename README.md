# Advent of Code 2023

This repo contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 edition.

My personal challenge for the last 2 years has been that I need to switch
languages every day and may not use any language twice. I am dropping that
requirement this year and will simply try to rotate between some of the
languages that I really want to get better at.

## What Languages/Tools I am considering

The languages I want to use the most for this are Haskell and Rust. I might
consider writing them in both languages, even. On top of that, just for the
sake of it, I would love to try writing some days in the Nix language. It
really is not made for this, but it could be a good way to familiarize myself
with it a bit more.
